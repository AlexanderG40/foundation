    <p>
        My hobby is snowboarding. I starded snowboarding since I was 6 years old. I was born in the mountains where the snow comes from the clouds. It is a pretty fun hobby for the winter.
         However it also comes at a downside, when you fall it hurts to get up and keep going. So I try not to fall! Better to be carefull than to break a bone and suffer 2 months with a cast.
